* Venus Emacs

[[./venus.jpg]]

Venus Emacs is a "slightly configured" Emacs flavor, made by
ksqsf. (It also hosts some packages that I have written for my own
convenience. See the last section.)

This configuration has been tested on macOS.

NOTE: This configuration only targets Emacs 28.1.  No guarantee about
forward/backward compatibility.  You can comment out the first
paragraph in =init.el= if you do want to try.

** Philosophy

My primary goals are

- Fast, and responsive
- Healthy, and easy on the eye
- Productive, and distraction-free
- Predictable
- Stable
- Maintainable codebase
- Prefer built-in functionality to third-party packages


I don't strive to achieve eye-candy and powerfulness, but they are
good, and may be considered in the future.

** Structure

There are two kinds of configuration, Module and Volatile.  The
distinction is (in my mind) very successful.

*** Module

Modules make up the functionality and keybindings.  They are stable
and can be byte compiled safely and cleanly.  Ideally, they use
lexical scoping.

*** Volatile

Volatile configuration files are more fragile and personal.  They are
mainly temporary tests or (let's hope not) ugly hacks.  A volatile
Lisp file should never be byte compiled.  Typically, it's dynamically
scoped.

** Fonts

The following fonts are "blessed" in this configuration.

| Font                 | Size | Usage                     |
|----------------------+------+---------------------------|
| (Any monospace font) |   14 | General use (non-Chinese) |
| Iosevka Term         |   14 | Tabular content           |

** Better Defaults

These modifications are generally in =prelude-core.el= and
=prelude-ui.el=.

User-*very*-visible modifications are listed here.

*** Modal editing

By default, [[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow][Meow]] is used to provide modal editing experience. See
=prelude-meow.el= for custom keybindings, especially ones in the leader
map.

*** Expand region

=C-SPC C-SPC= to expand the current region semantically.

*** Zap up to char

=M-z= was assigned to =zap-up-to-char=.  You can easily achieve what
=zap-to-char= does with =M-z <char> C-d=.

At first, I thought =M-z t= and =M-z f= would be cool, but it turned
out to be a horrible idea, because one must stop to think which key to
press.

*** Mode line

Doom mode line.

*** Quick Completion

I use Selectrum and Consult ecosystem.

*** REPL

Many major modes support REPL, but their keybindings are often
very different.  The following keychords are adopted by Emacs
itself, so they are preferred when possible.

| Key     | Function             |
|---------+----------------------|
| C-c C-c | Send buffer          |
| C-c C-l | Send file            |
| C-x C-e | Send this expression |
| C-M-x   | Send this function   |

**** Haskell, Idris

Haskell-mode has Interactive Haskell mode supporting ghci.  Due to
Haskell's specialness, all you can do is =C-c C-l=.

**** Python

Elpy defined a bunch of send functions, but they turn out to be not so
helpful.

**** Coq

Coq is an interactive proof assistant, whose Emacs interface is Proof
General, which defines its own set of commands.

*** Structured Editing

Structured editing is a novel editing experience that operates on the
level of "structures", be it expressions or statements.

I use paredit for the Lisp family. My preferred keybindings are:

| Key     | Function             |
|---------+----------------------|
| M-k     | Kill current         |
| M-up    | Splice               |
| M-left  | Slurp left           |
| M-right | Slurp right          |
| M-a     | Same level, backward |
| M-e     | Same level, forward  |

"Sentence" is the metaphor for "expression". Navigation by word is
useful, so I won't override it.

** Unlimited Lisp Works
This repo hosts some other Emacs Lisp works made by me for my own
convenience. It might be useful for you, too, so I made a list here
for better discoverability.

| Who          | Where                  | What                       |
|--------------+------------------------+----------------------------|
| pest-mode    | github ksqsf/pest-mode | Major mode for Pest files  |
| treefold     | ./lisp/treefold.el     | Fold any tree-like text    |
| smtlib2-mode | ./lisp/smtlib2-mode.el | Major mode for SMT scripts |
