* Venus Emacs

[[./venus.jpg]]

Venus Emacs is a "slightly configured" Emacs flavor, made by
ksqsf. (It also hosts some packages that I have written for my own
convenience. See the last section.)

This configuration has been tested on macOS and Debian.

NOTE: This configuration only targets Emacs 27.1.  No guarantee about
forward/backward compatibility.  You can comment out the first
paragraph in =init.el= if you do want to try.

** Philosophy

My primary goals are

- Fast, and responsive
- Healthy, and easy on the eye
- Productive, and distraction-free
- Predictable
- Stable
- Maintainable codebase
- Prefer built-in functionality to third-party packages


I don't strive to achieve eye-candy and powerfulness, but they are
good, and may be considered in the future.

** Structure

There are two kinds of configuration, Module and Volatile.  The
distinction is (in my mind) very successful.

*** Module

Modules make up the functionality and keybindings.  They are stable
and can be byte compiled safely and cleanly.  Ideally, they use
lexical scoping.

*** Volatile

Volatile configuration files are more fragile and personal.  They are
mainly temporary tests or (let's hope not) ugly hacks.  A volatile
Lisp file should never be byte compiled.  Typically, it's dynamically
scoped.

** Fonts

The following fonts are "blessed" in this configuration.

| Font         | Size | Usage                     |
|--------------+------+---------------------------|
| Fira Code    |   14 | General use (non-Chinese) |
| Iosevka Term |   14 | Tabular content           |

However, other fonts also seem to work well, like Monaco and Menlo.

** Better Defaults

These modifications are generally in =prelude-core.el= and
=prelude-ui.el=.

User-*very*-visible modifications are listed here.

*** Expand region

=C-SPC C-SPC= to expand the current region semantically.

*** Themes

The default theme (too bright) was replaced by [[https://srcery-colors.github.io][Srcery]].

*** Zap up to char

=M-z= was assigned to =zap-up-to-char=.  You can easily achieve what
=zap-to-char= does with =M-z <char> C-d=.

At first, I thought =M-z t= and =M-z f= would be cool, but it turned
out to be a horrible idea, because one must stop to think which key to
press.

*** Mode line

Doom mode line.

*** Quick Completion

I use Ivy and the Counsel family, as they tend to blend better
with other modern packages.

Over the months, I've tried several other setups, like ido and
icomplete that comes with Emacs itself, and the configs are still
there, but will not receive updates as often as Ivy+Counsel.  Just
customize =prelude-completion-framework=, if you want to try.

*** REPL

Many major modes support REPL, but their keybindings are often
very different.  The following keychords are adopted by Emacs
itself, so they are preferred when possible.

| Key     | Function             |
|---------+----------------------|
| C-c C-c | Send buffer          |
| C-c C-l | Send file            |
| C-x C-e | Send this expression |
| C-M-x   | Send this function   |

**** Haskell, Idris

Haskell-mode has Interactive Haskell mode supporting ghci.  Due to
Haskell's specialness, all you can do is =C-c C-l=.

**** Python

Elpy defined a bunch of send functions, but they turn out to be not so
helpful.

**** Coq

Coq is an interactive proof assistant, whose Emacs interface is Proof
General, which defines its own set of commands.

** Unlimited Lisp Works
This repo hosts some other Emacs Lisp works made by me for my own
convenience. It might be useful for you, too, so I made a list here
for better discoverability.

| Who       | Where                  | What                      |
|-----------+------------------------+---------------------------|
| pest-mode | github ksqsf/pest-mode | Major mode for Pest files |
| treefold  | ./lisp/treefold.el     | Fold any tree-like text   |
