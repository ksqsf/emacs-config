This is my finely tweaked Emacs configuration. I live on it every day.

I intend to keep it as small as possible, but unfortunately, it has
grown into several hundreds of lines of Lisp code, and it's now
necessary to back it up in case of data loss.

Note: This configuration is NOT self-contained. It requires some
external programs to work properly. To name a few:
* StarDict for sdcv.
* Proof General.
* doc-rfc from Debian.
* epdfinfo (refer to pdf-tools for details)
* fortune.

Some of my own Lisp functions:
* region ring
* window-configuration ring
* ACM mode (separate repo)
* jekyll blog
* google
* rfc
